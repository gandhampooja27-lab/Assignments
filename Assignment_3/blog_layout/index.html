          Lorem Ipsum is a dummy text commonly
          <span class="more">
            used in graphic design, publishing, and web development. Its primary
            purpose is to allow designers to create layouts and visual mockups
            without the distraction of meaningful content. This placeholder text
            helps to focus on the design elements, such as typography and
            layout, rather than the actual text itself.
